# Malloc-in-java

1. Declare an array of 25000 bytes.

2. You must implement a function that is like malloc(). Call it MyMalloc(). Its signature is similar to malloc(). You should also implement MyFree() which has a signature and functionality that are similar to free().

3. MyMalloc() allocates memory only from the previously mentioned array of 25000 bytes.

4. All the data structures that are required to manage the memory must also reside within the same array.

5. Upload only the mymalloc.c and mymalloc.h to UGVLE by the due date.
